In my project, I am using PHP for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend to build a more dynamic and interactive user experience. Although this is my first project integrating Vue.js with core PHP, I chose to use Vue.js to enhance frontend functionality.

Additionally, I have followed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in my backend development. I have also adhered to coding standards by following PHP-FIG PSR-4 Autoloading Standards and maintaining clean code best practices.

This project includes an admin, user, and participant dashboard. Every new user, upon registration, gets a fresh dashboard where they can create trips, manage trip itineraries, transportation, accommodations, expenses, and track budgets.

When a user creates a trip, participants can view all available trips and have the option to accept or decline invitations.
Participants will receive a notification three days before the trip's start date as a reminder.
Users can view which participants have joined their trips.



Admins have full visibility over all trips and can see which participants have joined each trip.


--------------Login and register system--------------

The project includes a login and registration system. After cloning the project, it can be run using the Visual Studio Code terminal by executing the command:

php -S localhost:8000 -t public

Three types of user accounts are available for testing:

Admin: admin@gmail.com password:123456

User: hasan@gmail.com password:123456

Participant: mahmudul@gmail.com password:123456

The registration process includes email verification to ensure user authenticity.

Once a participant accepts a trip, they are restricted from accepting any other trips that overlap with the selected tripâ€™s start and end dates.
After a trip's end date has passed, it is marked as expired, and no further actions can be taken for that trip.


-----------------------------12-03-2025--------------------------

Users can update their profile information, including their name, email,  password, country, city, phone, profile_photo, language, currency, gender.

Participants can also view the name,email, country,trip style of the user who created each trip, allowing for greater transparency and communication.

*Trip Rating and Review:

*Once a participant accepts a trip, they can rate and review the places visited during the trip. Participants can also view reviews from other trip participants, helping them make more informed decisions about the trips.

*When a trip's end date is expired, it will automatically disappear after three days. (For example, if today is August 5 and a trip ended on August 2, it will still be visible. On August 6, it will automatically disappear.)

*The total number of participants who have accepted the trip is displayed.

*Participants can also take part in trip-based polls. The poll results highlight the most liked options, offering insights into group preferences and experiences.


*Additionally, participants have the ability to follow users, allowing them to stay connected and updated on trips and activities created by those users. They can also view the trip history of the users they follow, including previously created and completed trips.


*If a participant declines a trip, it will be moved to the archived trips page for future reference. Additionally, a PayPal payment system has been integrated to provide participants with a secure and convenient payment option.


------------------------16-03-2025-----------------------------

*Participants can update their dashboard profile, including changing their name, email,  password, country, city, phone, profile_photo, language, currency, gender.


*When a participant makes a payment and the admin accepts it, only then can the participant officially join the trip. Once the payment is confirmed, the trip reminder countdown system starts.
