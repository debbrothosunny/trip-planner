In my project, I am using PHP for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 for the frontend because I am not familiar with Vue.js. This is my first project using core PHP, and given the 14-day timeframe, I don't have enough time to learn Vue.js and implement it. Therefore, I have chosen to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 for the frontend instead.

Additionally, I have followed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in my backend development. I have also adhered to coding standards by following PHP-FIG PSR-4 Autoloading Standards and maintaining clean code best practices.

This project includes an admin, user, and participant dashboard. Every new user, upon registration, gets a fresh dashboard where they can create trips, manage trip itineraries, transportation, accommodations, expenses, and track budgets.

When a user creates a trip, participants can view all available trips and have the option to accept or decline invitations.
Participants will receive a notification three days before the trip's start date as a reminder.
Users can view which participants have joined their trips.
Admins have full visibility over all trips and can see which participants have joined each trip.

Once a participant accepts a trip, they are restricted from accepting any other trips that overlap with the selected tripâ€™s start and end dates.
After a trip's end date has passed, it is marked as expired, and no further actions can be taken for that trip.

Users can update their profile information, including their name, email, and password.

Participants can also view the name and email of the user who created each trip, allowing for greater transparency and communication.

*Trip Rating and Review:

*Once a participant accepts a trip, they can rate and review the places visited during the trip. Participants can also view reviews from other trip participants, helping them make more informed decisions about the trips.

*When a trip's end date has passed, the accepted trip is marked as completed.

*The total number of participants who have accepted the trip is displayed.



-----------16-03-2025------------------

*When a trip's end date is expired, it will automatically disappear after three days. (For example, if today is August 5 and a trip ended on August 2, it will still be visible. On August 6, it will automatically disappear.)


*Participants can update their dashboard profile, including changing their name, email, and password.


*When a participant makes a payment and the admin accepts it, only then can the participant officially join the trip. Once the payment is confirmed, the trip reminder countdown system starts.

*The admin has the ability to view all payment details made by participants for trips.


*****Upcoming Features (Hotel Booking/Flight Booking):****************************

Hotel booking and flight booking functionality is currently under development and will be included in the next update.




--------------------------Hotel Booking 19-03-2025---------------------------

The admin can create hotels and hotel rooms. When a user creates accommodation and selects a location, the system dynamically retrieves and displays the available hotel names based on the selected location using AJAX. Upon selecting a hotel, the system will show details such as room types, prices, available rooms, and price per night. The user can then select a room along with the check-in and check-out dates.

Initially, when the user creates accommodation, the status will be marked as "pending." Once the admin confirms the accommodation booking, it will be marked as "booked" by the user. Additionally, the system ensures that the selected check-in and check-out dates are blocked for other users, preventing double bookings for the same dates.
