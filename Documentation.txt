In my project, I am using PHP for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 for the frontend because I am not familiar with Vue.js. This is my first project using core PHP, and given the 14-day timeframe, I don't have enough time to learn Vue.js and implement it. Therefore, I have chosen to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 for the frontend instead.

Additionally, I have followed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in my backend development. I have also adhered to coding standards by following PHP-FIG PSR-4 Autoloading Standards and maintaining clean code best practices.

This project includes an admin, user, and participant dashboard. Every new user, upon registration, gets a fresh dashboard where they can create trips, manage trip itineraries, transportation, accommodations, expenses, and track budgets.

When a user creates a trip, participants can view all available trips and have the option to accept or decline invitations.
Once a participant accepts a trip, they receive a notification three days before the trip's start date as a reminder.
Users can view which participants have joined their trips.
Admins have full visibility over all trips and can see which participants have joined each trip.
